# WAL Technical Report

Status: pre-alpha research framework  
Date: 2026-05-09  
Repository focus: WeightOps workflows for reproducible, testable model edits

## Executive Summary

WAL is a research-grade WeightOps framework prototype for managing model edits as recipes, building reproducible artifacts, validating behavior through CI gates, and debugging regressions through provenance tools.

The strongest current result is not a claim of mature production deployment. The strongest result is that the project now has an end-to-end platform skeleton:

- recipe-based edit representation
- deterministic build/tag/rollback workflows
- behavioral test gates
- result schema validation
- audit logs and release notes
- debugging prototypes such as blame, bisect, checksum, and time travel
- deployment simulations such as canary, shadow, hotfix, and emergency stop

The public framing should remain conservative: WAL is a broad pre-alpha prototype with strong demo readiness and incomplete scientific validation.

## Project Scope

WAL currently contains several layers:

- **Core runtime**: recipe loading, build metadata, basic runtime helpers, and WAL package APIs.
- **CLI and build tooling**: init/build/status/config-style workflows plus legacy framework commands.
- **Experiment corpus**: milestone scripts from early validation through M627, including historical research, infrastructure, docs, and audit modules.
- **Book and diary**: per-module book entries and a long-form Russian developer diary.
- **Studio demo**: a scripted WAL Studio v0.1 walkthrough for product demonstrations.
- **CI assets**: GitHub workflow, issue templates, tests, and validation gates.

The corpus is intentionally broad. It should not be summarized as hundreds of independent scientific validations. It contains real tests, simulations, docs generators, audits, migration scripts, and platform prototypes.

The M625 sweep is a safe local execution pass, not a claim that every historical experiment is executable on the current machine. Heavy model runs, GPU/HF probes, destructive scripts, backup/restore scripts, git-mutating scripts, and public-doc regeneration scripts are blocked by policy and recorded as `BLOCKED`.

M628-M631 convert that blocked group into a controlled runner plan: model runners, GPU-heavy runners, mutation dry-runs, docs/public-claim gates, and security/abuse runners are tracked separately from safe-core checks.

M632-M638 now have three unique local small-model controlled workflows: SmolLM2-360M, Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct, and TinyLlama-1.1B. M632, M633, M635, and the aggregate M636-M638 gates pass. M634 remains `BLOCKED` because no Gemma-small local snapshot is available. These gates validate local runtime/artifact lifecycle portability, not semantic weight-edit training.

M639-M645 add corpus and routing contracts for robustness. These are not model-behavior claims; M645 is explicitly `SIMULATED` because no real hybrid backend is executed.

M646-M651 harden CI inputs and scoring: negative prompts, lure prompts, long-context payloads, generated-test quality, score calibration, and behavioral checksum drift are checked as deterministic contracts, not real model-behavior claims.

M652-M658 add security and abuse contracts. They are static deterministic gates, not an external security audit and not a production-readiness claim.

M659-M668 add deployment-reality contracts. M659 uses a local loopback server, but M666 is explicitly `BLOCKED` because a real 24h soak test must not be faked, and M667 is `SIMULATED` because it is only a short memory sentinel.

M669-M675 add product polish and release dry-run gates for the pre-alpha public release path.

## Status Semantics

WAL now uses explicit statuses for result interpretation:

- `PASS`: completed successfully.
- `FAIL`: executed and failed.
- `BLOCKED`: intentionally not executed because the environment or safety policy blocks it.
- `UNSUPPORTED`: the target configuration is not supported.
- `SIMULATED`: result comes from a simulation or mock.
- `DOC_ONLY`: documentation-only module.
- `NO_DATA`: no measurable data was produced.

This matters because historical false-positive results were found and corrected. For example, CUDA OOM and unsupported Qwen-VL configuration cases are no longer represented as successful passes.

## Strengths

- **Breadth**: the project covers model edit lifecycle management, CI, debugging, deployment simulation, documentation, and release mechanics.
- **Operational thinking**: rollback, audit trail, release notes, hotfix, canary, and shadow workflows are present as prototypes.
- **Traceability**: experiments have result JSON files, book entries, and diary entries.
- **Release hygiene**: result schema validation, truthfulness checks, and safe runtime sweeps exist.
- **Demo readiness**: WAL Studio can present a coherent product story without requiring heavy model execution.

## Limitations

- **Scientific validation is incomplete**: the framework still needs semantic weight-edit training and realistic behavioral testing before claims about generality are defensible.
- **Many modules are simulations**: deployment, registry, and operational modules often validate concepts rather than production infrastructure.
- **Not every script is safe to run locally**: some scripts depend on large local models, GPUs, Hugging Face assets, backups, git mutation, or long-running probes.
- **Historical corpus is heterogeneous**: old experiments mix research scripts, docs generators, one-off migrations, and product prototypes.
- **Performance claims are local**: speedups and memory changes should be treated as environment-specific until reproduced under controlled protocols.

## Recommended Public Claims

Use:

- pre-alpha WeightOps framework
- research-grade prototype
- end-to-end demo workflow
- reproducible recipe/build/test/rollback concepts
- broad infrastructure prototype

Avoid:

- mature production deployment claims
- blanket certification language
- claims that all modules are real-world validations
- unsupported cross-model generalization claims

## Next Validation Protocol

The small-model controlled runtime/artifact protocol now has three passing local model paths. The next useful technical milestone is semantic edit training on that same protocol:

```text
models:
  - SmolLM2-360M-Instruct
  - Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
  - TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat
  - optional Gemma-small when a local snapshot is available

workflow:
  1. init project
  2. add recipe
  3. train or apply a real edit
  4. build WAL artifact
  5. run exact behavior test
  6. run negative behavior test
  7. run context behavior test
  8. tag passing build
  9. introduce bad edit
  10. detect CI failure
  11. blame/bisect regression
  12. rollback
  13. regenerate release notes
```

This would convert the current portability proof into defensible model-edit validation.

## Current Release Readiness

```text
Solo research prototype:       strong
GitHub pre-alpha release:      acceptable after honest framing
Demo readiness:                high
Scientific validation:         medium
Production readiness:          low-to-medium
```

The practical release path is:

1. keep public wording conservative;
2. keep result schema gates green;
3. document blocked/unsupported/simulated modules explicitly;
4. build one polished demo scenario;
5. add cross-model small-model validation.
